Users can now associate Glo cards with pull requests created from within the GitKraken Git Client. 
When creating a new pull request, simply search for the Glo card you wish to associate. 
The pull request description will then be updated to include a link to said card. 

Better yet, if you’ve set up the GitHub pull request integration, 
you can trigger an automatic change to progress your card to a new column the moment your PR status changes. 

- Users can now control the max number of commits that display in your graph. Navigate to <kbd>Preferences</kbd> → <kbd>General</kbd> and set a value for `Max Commits in Graph`. You will also see an option to `Show All Commits in Graph`. 

- Users can now resize the text field to amend commit messages, and the <button class='button button--success button--ui button--nolink'>Update Message</button> and <button class='button button--danger button--ui button--nolink'>Cancel Amend</button> buttons are now closer to the text field. 
- SSH keys using the OpenSSH format are now supported.   

- Users can successfully drag-and-drop remote references to generate the menu option to start a pull request. 
- Users can switch tabs without the operation feeling sluggish. 
- Initials will correctly display inside of `Blame View` instead of Gravatar images when the `Display author initials instead of avatars` option is selected. 
- Keyboard shortcuts for Glo will now work after switching to a Glo tab. 
- If Glo is unreachable from the GitKraken Client, the application will correctly timeout and show an error message instead of hanging indefinitely.
